Use the RStudio tool to install any libraries you are missing.\n\nlibrary(socmod)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nTo start we need to initialize our model and the agents using make_abm and initialize_agents from socmod. We specify that there are ten agents and no network structure by explicitly providing an empty graph (no edges) with ten nodes to the graph named argument.\nWe set two agents to be in the seed set who receive “direct instruction”, i.e., we set the behaviors of two randomly-chosen agents to be “Adaptive”. “Adaptive” and “Legacy” are the two default values for agent behaviors, so there is no need to specify these. The initial_prevalence passed to initialize_agents is implicitly the initial prevalence of the adaptive behavior.\n\n# Initialize the ABM and agents\nabm &lt;- \n  make_abm(graph = igraph::make_empty_graph(10)) |&gt;\n  initialize_agents(initial_prevalence = 0.2)\n\n# Inspect the initialization to ensure 2 of 10 are A-doers\nplot_network_adoption(\n  abm, layout = igraph::in_circle(), \n  plot_mod = \\(p) p + ggtitle(\"Adoption at t = 0\")\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Conformity model dynamics\n\nconformity_dynamics &lt;- make_model_dynamics(\n  \n  # Partner selection is not necessary in conformity\n  partner_selection = \\(focal_agent, model) {},\n  \n  # Conformity interaction is not partner-based, so use dummy arg\n  interaction = \\(focal_agent, ., model) {\n    \n    # Observe behaviors of randomly-chosen demonstrators\n    behaviors_sample &lt;- sample(model$agent_behaviors, \n                               model$n_demonstrators)\n    \n    # Count how many of each behavior is present\n    behaviors_table &lt;- table(behaviors_sample)\n    print(behaviors_table)\n    \n    # Sample behavior to copy, weighted by frequency; names are behaviors\n    next_behavior &lt;- sample(names(behaviors_table), 1, behaviors_table)\n      \n    # Only need to set next behavior, payoffs irrelevant w/ conformity\n    focal_agent$set_next_behavior(next_behavior)\n  },\n  # Use the learning model stepper that makes \"next\" behavior/payoff \"current\"\n  model_step = learning_model_step\n)\n\nLet’s define the agent-based model again, this time with more agents. We will also run a single trial and plot observations of the simulated prevalence dynamics.\nWhen I do little experiments like this I set up single cells that can run an entire model setup and simulation trial. Then I keep running it to see what changes.\n\nsource(\"R/model.R\")\n\nt1 &lt;- single_conformity_trial(n_agents = 100, n_demonstrators = 3)\nt2 &lt;- single_conformity_trial(n_agents = 100, n_demonstrators = 3)\nt3 &lt;- single_conformity_trial(n_agents = 100, n_demonstrators = 3)\n\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# Plot prevalence dynamics of Adaptive behavior only\np1 &lt;- plot_prevalence(t1, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Adaptive\")) + ggtitle(\"Trial 1\") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12))\n\nWarning: Removed non-summary-safe metadata: agent_behaviors\n\np2 &lt;- plot_prevalence(t2, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Adaptive\")) + ggtitle(\"Trial 2\") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12))\n\nWarning: Removed non-summary-safe metadata: agent_behaviors\n\np3 &lt;- plot_prevalence(t3, tracked_behaviors = c(\"Adaptive\")) + ggtitle(\"Trial 3\") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12))\n\nWarning: Removed non-summary-safe metadata: agent_behaviors\n\n(p1 / p2 / p3) +\n  plot_layout(guides = \"collect\", axes = \"collect\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConformity dynamics with different initial \\(a\\)\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Success-biased model dynamics\n\nWe define “success” here as the fitness of one’s behavior. Learners are biased towards teachers who are more successful in success-biased learning.\n\nThis means we need to implement partner selection, which samples some number of demonstrators, then samples one randomly, weighted by payoff.\nInteraction is simple in this model: we assume perfect learning, i.e., the learner always adopts its chosen teacher’s behavior"

    "text": "Opinions are equivalent to beliefs or attitudes: they are theoretical constructions hypothesized to affect behavior, but need not be based on evidence or experience, but hearsay from others.\nPolarization and extremism incapacitate the institutions responsible for forest and coastline management, to name two examples. In forest management, we know prescribed burns could prevent catastrophic wildfires (Eisenberg et al. 2019; Kolden 2019). So although we have Indigenous practices for climate action (SDG 13) and the protection of Life on Land (SDG 15) they are ignored in favor of maladaptive modern practices. These traditional practices have helped historically local inhabitants over thousands of years, and they can still help now.\nOpinion science, then, can help us answer the primary puzzle of sustainable adaptation: why do maladaptive, unsustainable practices take hold and not adaptive, sustainable ones Figure 1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The puzzle of adaptation."
