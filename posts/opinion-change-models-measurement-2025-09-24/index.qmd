# Introduction

- Opinions are equivalent to beliefs or attitudes: they are theoretical constructions hypothesized to affect behavior, but need not be based on evidence or experience, but hearsay from others.
- Polarization and extremism incapacitate the institutions responsible for
  forest and coastline management, to name two examples. In forest management,
  we know prescribed burns could prevent catastrophic wildfires 
  [@Eisenberg2019;@Kolden2019]. 
  So although we have Indigenous practices for climate action ([SDG 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13))
  and the protection of Life on Land ([SDG
  15](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)) they are ignored in favor of
  maladaptive modern practices. These traditional practices have helped
  historically local inhabitants over thousands of years, and they can still
  help now.
- Opinion science, then, can help us answer the primary puzzle of
  sustainable adaptation: why do maladaptive, unsustainable practices take hold 
  and not adaptive, sustainable ones [@fig-puzzle-of-adaptation]?

# Models

- Models of opinion change began with @DeGroot1974 who developed a model that
  calculates the final opinion of a group given initial opinions and the social
  network representing who interacts with whom. 
  - We call this model of opinion change in DeGroot's model *simple consensus*. 
    In this model process, two people interacting will both come to have the mean
    of their initial opinions. People don't ignore
    each other, they don't cause others to be repulsed becoming more oppositely
    extreme, and people are all equally stubborn. The model social groups 
    DeGroot simulated with his model were small, with *ad hoc* social network
    choices, not motivated by specific empirical questions. This is perfectly
    fine, the normal course of science. 
    DeGroot's paper provided the impulse and the theoretical foundations that
    modern opinion science models have expanded on to include 
    richer representations of real-world social influence processes.
- Opinion change became progressively more complex over the years. 
  Some of the first opinion change models in the decades following DeGroot 
  assumed social influence could either lead to 
  1. Greater consensus if the people interacting are similar enough.
  2. People ignore each other if they are too different.
- Continuing to build, @Macy2003 operationalized consensus, gradual ignorance
  increase with opinion distance, and opinion *repulsion* where people become
  even more opposed to one another in their opinions following an interaction.
  - Macy and colleagues adapted the *Hopfield network* as their model of opinion
    change, which is an abstract model of polarity change in networks. @Hopfield1982  
    first developed this to simulate "neural networks and physical systems". 
  - @Flache2011 
- Modern models are *generative*, with different types serving different
  purposes. Many problems in opinion science were articulated about the same
  time as computing power became widely available enough for scientists to be
  able to use agent-based modeling *en masse*. 


# Measurement

## Legacy opinion change measurement


## Why this is a problem


## Correct opinion change measurement


# Case study: echo chamber radicalization (aka *group polarization*)

- We can use the models and measurement we learned so far to 
  1. simulate *echo chamber radicalization*, which we will call *group
     polarization* because it's shorter and that's it's name for social
     psychologists. But we tend to think of polarization as being when two
     opposing groups are extremely rigidly opposed to each other; some
     sociologists call this "bi-polarization" to differentiate the everyday
     layperson's definition of "polarization" from what social psychologists 
     called "group polarization".
  2. show how we can estimate the false discovery rate and statistical power of
     hone experimental design to calculate the false discovery rate


# Discussion

- I wanted to include *sentiment analysis* because it seems like it's measuring
  something like an opinion if we analyze just one person's speech or writing.
  But something tells me it needs to be worked out more.
