# Introduction

-   Opinions are equivalent to beliefs or attitudes: they are theoretical
    constructions hypothesized to affect behavior, but need not be based on
    evidence or experience, but hearsay from others.
-   Polarization and extremism incapacitate the institutions responsible for
    forest and coastline management, to name two examples. In forest management,
    we know prescribed burns could prevent catastrophic wildfires
    [@Eisenberg2019; @Kolden2019]. So although we have Indigenous practices for
    climate action ([SDG 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)) and the
    protection of Life on Land ([SDG 15](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)) they
    are ignored in favor of maladaptive modern practices. These traditional
    practices have helped historically local inhabitants over thousands of
    years, and they can still help now.
-   Opinion science, then, can help us answer the primary puzzle of sustainable
    adaptation: why do maladaptive, unsustainable practices take hold and not
    adaptive, sustainable ones [@fig-puzzle-of-adaptation]?

# Models

-   Models of opinion change began with @DeGroot1974 who developed a model that
    calculates the final opinion of a group given initial opinions and the
    social network representing who interacts with whom.
    -   We call this model of opinion change in DeGroot's model *simple
        consensus*. In this model process, two people interacting will both come
        to have the mean of their initial opinions. People don't ignore each
        other, they don't cause others to be repulsed becoming more oppositely
        extreme, and people are all equally stubborn. The model social groups
        DeGroot simulated with his model were small, with *ad hoc* social
        network choices, not motivated by specific empirical questions. This is
        perfectly fine, the normal course of science. DeGroot's paper provided
        the impulse and the theoretical foundations that modern opinion science
        models have expanded on to include richer representations of real-world
        social influence processes.
-   Opinion change became progressively more complex over the years. Some of the
    first opinion change models in the decades following DeGroot assumed social
    influence could either lead to
    1.  Greater consensus if the people interacting are similar enough.
    2.  People ignore each other if they are too different.
-   Continuing to build, @Macy2003 operationalized consensus, gradual ignorance
    increase with opinion distance, and opinion *repulsion* where people become
    even more opposed to one another in their opinions following an interaction.
    -   Macy and colleagues adapted the *Hopfield network* as their model of
        opinion change, which is an abstract model of polarity change in
        networks. @Hopfield1982\
        first developed this to simulate "neural networks and physical systems".
    -   @Flache2011
-   Modern opinion dynamics models are mostly *generative*, with different types
    serving different purposes. Many problems in opinion science were
    articulated about the same time as computing power became widely available
    enough for scientists to be able to use agent-based modeling *en masse*.
-   It does seem like there exist

## Social influence dynamics

-   Social *influence* can change opinions a little or a lot. This is different
    from the social *learning* that fuels behavior change, where someone either
    does something or they don'tâ€”it's binary.
-   In social influence, people can either develop similar opinions as their
    peers, or ignore their peers' opinions, just as people can either adopt or
    ignore their peers' *behaviors* in social learning. In the language of
    opinion dynamics, peers find *consensus* subject to *biased assimilation*.
    *Consensus* means becoming more similar in opinion. *Biased assimilation* is
    the technical name for the human tendency to preferentially attend to
    information that agrees with our current beliefs and ignore information that
    doesn't.
-   There is a third possibility when it comes to opinions we can call
    *anti-consensus*, or repulsive social influence where people who disagree a
    lot already tend to disagree more after they interact with each other (i.e.,
    after they influence one another through discourse).
-   Fourth, and finally, we incorporate the empirical fact that stubbornness


### Opinion Dynamics

We consider agents $i$ with a vector of latent opinions  

$$
\mathbf{o}_i = (o_{i1}, o_{i2}, \ldots, o_{iC}),
$$ {#eq-opinion-vector}

where $C$ is the cultural complexity (number of opinion dimensions).  

### Stubbornness

Stubbornness scales the responsiveness of an opinion to social influence:

$$
s(o;\alpha) \;=\; \frac{1}{1 + |o|^\alpha}.
$$ {#eq-stubbornness}

Moderate opinions ($o \approx 0$) are highly flexible ($s(o)\approx 1$), while extreme opinions ($|o| \gg 0$) become increasingly stubborn ($s(o) \to 0$).  
This form works for both bounded and unbounded opinions: bounded models impose limits externally, while unbounded models retain smooth decay.

### Dyadic Interaction

When focal agent $i$ interacts with partner $j$, each opinion component is updated by

$$
o_{i,c}' \;=\; o_{i,c} + \alpha \, s(o_{i,c}) \,\bigl(o_{j,c} - o_{i,c}\bigr),
$$ {#eq-dyadic-update}

where:

- $c \in \{1, \dots, C\}$ indexes the opinion dimension,  
- $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is the global learning rate,  
- $s(o_{i,c})$ is stubbornness from @eq-stubbornness.  

### Iteration

After all dyadic interactions in a time step, opinions are updated synchronously:

$$
\mathbf{o}_i \;\leftarrow\; \mathbf{o}_i'.
$$ {#eq-iteration}


# Measurement

-   In this lecture we focus on measuring opinion change measured with survey
    responses.
-   We'll also review

## Opinions

## Opinion change

## Surveys

## Legacy opinion change measurement

## Why this is a problem

## Correct opinion change measurement

# Case study: echo chamber radicalization (aka *group polarization*)

-   We can use the models and measurement we learned so far to
    1.  simulate *echo chamber radicalization*, which we will call *group
        polarization* because it's shorter and that's it's name for social
        psychologists. But we tend to think of polarization as being when two
        opposing groups are extremely rigidly opposed to each other; some
        sociologists call this "bi-polarization" to differentiate the everyday
        layperson's definition of "polarization" from what social psychologists
        called "group polarization".
    2.  show how we can estimate the false discovery rate and statistical power
        of hone experimental design to calculate the false discovery rate

# Discussion

-   I wanted to include *sentiment analysis* because it seems like it's
    measuring something like an opinion if we analyze just one person's speech
    or writing. But something tells me it needs to be worked out more.
