Social influence shapes opinions in ways that matter for sustainability. Unlike behaviors, which are adopted or not, opinions shift gradually—toward, away from, or resistant to those of others. We can think of assimilation as a scale: at one end, consensus, where people grow more similar through interaction; at the other, anti-consensus, where disagreement deepens; and in the middle, a zone of zero influence, through ignorance or defiance. These dynamics aren’t visible in behavior alone. A closer look at group polarization shows how extreme, inflexible actors can shift group outcomes even when average opinions appear unchanged. If we understand how opinions move—not just what people do—we can design influence, not just react to it.

# Introduction: opinion change, instutitions, and sustainability

- Opinions are equivalent to beliefs or attitudes: they are theoretical constructions hypothesized to affect behavior, but need not be based on evidence or experience, but hearsay from others.
- Polarization and extremism incapacitate the institutions responsible for
  forest and coastline management, to name two examples. In forest management,
  we know prescribed burns could prevent catastrophic wildfires 
  [@Eisenberg2019;@Kolden2019]. 
  So although we have Indigenous practices for climate action ([SDG 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13))
  and the protection of Life on Land ([SDG
  15](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)) they are ignored in favor of
  maladaptive modern practices. These traditional practices have helped
  historically local inhabitants over thousands of years, and they can still
  help now.
- Opinion science, then, can help us answer the primary puzzle of
  sustainable adaptation: why do maladaptive, unsustainable practices take hold 
  and not adaptive, sustainable ones [@fig-puzzle-of-adaptation]?

# Opinion dynamics models

The scientific study of change in the physical world is often called *dynamics*.
Therefore, we call the scientific study of opinion change *opinion dynamics*,
terminology shared by sociologists, cognitive scientists, and species of 
social scientist. 

Opinion dynamics can take several forms, but we can trace a through-line of
the development of what we can now call *social influence* opinion dynamics.
Social influence dynamics calculate the *influence* that one person's opinions
have on another person's, with discourse or discussion being the "force carrier" 
through which influence is achieved. The *social influence* on a person's
opinions is a scalar value, which we denote $\Delta o$, where 
$\Delta$ is the classic prefix we add to mean "change in" the variable that
follows it—the opinion $o$, in this case. The sign of one's opinion $o$ 
represents the *valence* of their opinion—how "negative" or "positive". 
The magnitude of one's opinion represents their extremism [@Blau1974]. Note this
implies *opinions* exist within limited affordances of different *topics*, 
which themselves are latent and unobservable.

### DeGroot's simple consensus dynamic

@DeGroot1974 developed an early *simple consensus* influence dynamic where 
interaction always increases opinion similarity through iterated averaging.

### Bounded confidence dynamic

@Hegselmann2002, @Lorenz2007, and colleagues augmented simple consensus.

### Social influence dynamics

@Macy2003 first introduced what I call *social influence* dynamics. 
Social influence dynamics incorporates gradual consensus or anti-consensus—
in other words, opinion "repulsion"—plus the tendency to *biased
assimilation* of information, where people ignore information that is
neither supportive or challenging enough to catch their interest. This
model was adapted from the Hopfield network model to explain the physical processes
underlying memory in cognitive science (see margin note right). 
@Flache2011 took this a step further to investigate how social networks
might affect whether societies became highly polarized or not. 
In @Turner2018 I used simulations I also formally calculated the
polarization in the limiting case where everyone's opinions are set to one
extreme or another at random.

**Stubborn extremism: a hidden assumption of the Hopfield model.** 
@Hopfield1982 first developed this model to simulate 
physical mechanisms for memory in
analog-valued neural networks. Neurons have a maximum amount they can be
electro-chemically activated either positively or negatively while they do their job in our brains.
Hopfield encoded this in his model as a smoothing factor that made neuron
activation
change more slowly when closer to ±1. In social influence, this limitation of 
neurons becomes "stubborn extremism" automatically. Stubborn extremism has relatively rich
empirical support, which I review in @Turner2020—but its original inclusion
in social influence dynamics appears to be a coincidence!
:::

These approaches can generate emergent social phenomena like radicalization
(*group polarization*) from empirically-motivated model assumptions about social
influence dynamics. This signals to us that we have a plausible mechanistic
model: a causal story supported by evidence about real-world social influence
mechanisms produced by a pluralism of social science disciplines. 


# Measurement

- In this lecture we focus on measuring opinion change measured with survey
  responses. 
- We'll also review 

## Opinions

## Opinion change


## Surveys

## Legacy opinion change measurement


## Why this is a problem


## Correct opinion change measurement


# Case study: echo chamber radicalization (aka *group polarization*)

- We can use the models and measurement we learned so far to 
  1. simulate *echo chamber radicalization*, which we will call *group
     polarization* because it's shorter and that's it's name for social
     psychologists. But we tend to think of polarization as being when two
     opposing groups are extremely rigidly opposed to each other; some
     sociologists call this "bi-polarization" to differentiate the everyday
     layperson's definition of "polarization" from what social psychologists 
     called "group polarization".
  2. show how we can estimate the false discovery rate and statistical power of
     hone experimental design to calculate the false discovery rate


# Discussion

- I wanted to include *sentiment analysis* because it seems like it's measuring
  something like an opinion if we analyze just one person's speech or writing.
  But something tells me it needs to be worked out more.
