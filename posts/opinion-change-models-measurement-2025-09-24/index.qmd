# Introduction

- Opinions are equivalent to beliefs or attitudes: they are theoretical constructions hypothesized to affect behavior, but need not be based on evidence or experience, but hearsay from others.
- Polarization and extremism incapacitate the institutions responsible for
  forest and coastline management, to name two examples. In forest management,
  we know prescribed burns could prevent catastrophic wildfires 
  [@Eisenberg2019;@Kolden2019]. 
  So although we have Indigenous practices for climate action ([SDG 13](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13))
  and the protection of Life on Land ([SDG
  15](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)) they are ignored in favor of
  maladaptive modern practices. These traditional practices have helped
  historically local inhabitants over thousands of years, and they can still
  help now.
  
- Models of opinion change began with @DeGroot1974 who developed a model that
  calculates the final opinion of a group given initial opinions and the social
  network representing who interacts with whom.
